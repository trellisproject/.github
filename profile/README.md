# Trellis

Hi, we're Trellis, we are making a Church Management System (ChMS) for the modern era.

[Our webpage](https://trellis.netlify.app) has more details, however we are planning to use **RedwoodJS** to build our API and web frontend, and add a mobile app once Redwood reaches 1.0 and add support for a mobile side.
