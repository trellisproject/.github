# Trellis

Hi, we're Trellis, we are making a Church Management System (ChMS) for the modern era.

[Our webpage](https://trellis.netlify.app) has more details, however we are planning to use **Prisma with Apollo Server** for the backend, **Next.js** for the web frontend, and **React Native** for the mobile applications.
